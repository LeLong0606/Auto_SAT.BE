# ?? SAT.BE Authentication System - Complete Implementation with Role-Based Authorization

## ? **AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND FIXED**

The SAT.BE API now has a complete authentication system with registration, login, JWT tokens, and **hierarchical role-based authorization** with proper employee reference handling!

---

## ?? **Quick Start Guide**

### **1. Start the Application**
```bash
dotnet run
```

### **2. Access Swagger UI**
Navigate to: `https://localhost:7232/swagger`

### **3. Try the Authentication System**
The API now includes:
- ? **User Registration** - Create new accounts with automatic role assignment
- ? **Employee Linking** - Proper employee reference validation and linking
- ? **User Login** - Get JWT tokens with role and permission claims
- ? **Token Refresh** - Refresh expired tokens
- ? **Hierarchical Authorization** - Role-based access control with team restrictions
- ? **Permission-Based API Access** - Fine-grained endpoint protection

---

## ?? **FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **? Issue 1: 500 Error during Registration - FIXED**
- **Problem**: Registration was failing due to role assignment issues
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced role determination based on employee work position level
  - Proper error handling for employee validation
  - Automatic role assignment with fallback to "User" role
  - Added claims-based permission system

### **? Issue 2: EmployeeId Reference Problem - FIXED**
- **Problem**: EmployeeId didn't properly reference the Employees table
- **Solution**:
  - Added comprehensive employee validation during registration
  - Proper foreign key relationship checking
  - Employee data loading with department and work position
  - Automatic role assignment based on employee position level

### **? Issue 3: Role-Based Authorization System - IMPLEMENTED**
- **Solution**:
  - **TeamLeader Role**: Can view team members and assign shifts to team members only
  - **Director Role**: Can create shifts for all employees and view all data
  - **Manager Role**: Can manage their department
  - **Admin/SuperAdmin**: Full system access
  - **Employee Role**: Limited to personal data access

### **? Issue 4: Hierarchical Permission System - IMPLEMENTED**
- **Solution**:
  - Permission-based authorization attributes
  - Team-specific access control
  - Department-based filtering
  - Position-level hierarchy validation

---

## ?? **ROLE HIERARCHY SYSTEM**

### **Role Levels (Higher = More Access)**
1. **SuperAdmin (Level 10)** - Full system access
2. **Admin (Level 9)** - Administrative access
3. **Director (Level 8)** - Can create shifts for ALL employees, view all data
4. **Manager (Level 7)** - Department management
5. **HR (Level 6)** - Employee management across departments
6. **TeamLeader (Level 5)** - Can view team members and assign shifts to team members ONLY
7. **Employee (Level 4)** - Limited personal access
8. **User (Level 1)** - Basic read-only access

### **Automatic Role Assignment Based on Employee Position**
```csharp
// Role assignment logic in AuthService
switch (employee.WorkPosition.Level)
{
    case 1: return "Employee";     // Level 1: Basic employee
    case 2: return "Employee";     // Level 2: Senior employee  
    case 3: return "TeamLeader";   // Level 3: Team leader
    case 4: return "Director";     // Level 4: Director
    case 5: return "Manager";      // Level 5: Manager
    default: return "Employee";
}

// Department leaders automatically get Manager role
if (isDepartmentLeader) return "Manager";
```

  - `Admin`: Full access

### **Authorization Attributes Used**
```csharp
[HasPermission(PermissionConstants.EMPLOYEE_VIEW)]          // Permission-based
[HasMinimumRole(RoleHierarchy.TEAM_LEADER)]                // Role hierarchy-based
[TeamAccess]                                               // Team-specific access
[DepartmentAccess]                                         // Department-specific access
```

## ?? **Registration with Employee Linking**

### **Register User Linked to Employee**
```http
POST /api/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "john.teamleader@company.com",
  "password": "SecurePass123!",
  "confirmPassword": "SecurePass123!",
  "fullName": "John Team Leader",
  "phoneNumber": "+1234567890",
  "employeeId": 2
}
```

### **Automatic Role Assignment Response**
```json
{
  "isSuccess": true,
  "message": "User registered successfully.",
  "data": {
    "userId": 6,
    "email": "john.teamleader@company.com",

  "message": "Login successful.",
  "data": {
    "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
    "refreshToken": "abc123-def456-ghi789...",

      "username": "teamleader@satbe.com",
      "email": "teamleader@satbe.com",
      "firstName": "Sarah",
      "lastName": "TeamLeader",
      "roles": ["TeamLeader", "User"],
      "permissions": [
        "EMPLOYEE_VIEW",

## ?? **How to Use with Swagger UI**

### **Step 1: Register User with Employee Link**
1. First, get available employees: `GET /api/employees`
2. Register with employeeId: `POST /api/auth/register`
3. System automatically assigns role based on employee position

### **Step 2: Login and Get Enhanced Token**
1. Login: `POST /api/auth/login`
2. **Copy the `accessToken`** - now includes role and permission claims

### **Step 3: Authorize in Swagger**
1. Click **?? "Authorize" button**
2. Enter: `Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE`
3. Now you have access based on your role level!

### **Step 4: Test Role-Based Access**
- **As Employee**: Can only see own data
- **As TeamLeader**: Can see team members and create their shifts
- **As Director**: Can see all employees and create shifts for everyone

## ?? **Testing Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Team Leader Access**
```bash
# 1. Login as team leader
curl -X POST "https://localhost:7232/api/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "teamleader@satbe.com", "password": "TeamLeader123!"}'

# 2. Try to view employees (should only see team members)
curl -X GET "https://localhost:7232/api/employees" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

curl -X POST "https://localhost:7232/api/shiftassignments" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \

# 4. Try to create shift for employee in different department (should fail)
curl -X POST "https://localhost:7232/api/shiftassignments" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"employeeId": 99, "shiftId": 1, "date": "2024-01-17"}'
```

### **Scenario 2: Director Access**
```bash
# 1. Login as director

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "director@satbe.com", "password": "Director123!"}'

# 2. View all employees (should succeed)
curl -X GET "https://localhost:7232/api/employees" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# 3. Create shift for ANY employee (should succeed)
curl -X POST "https://localhost:7232/api/shiftassignments" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"employeeId": 99, "shiftId": 1, "date": "2024-01-17"}'
```
